With my time at UT coming to a close, I figured I would add an appreciation post to what got me through my four years of college, Monster. Reticulate allowed me to use both R and Python to show off my favorite flavors; however, the sugar free white can is my staple. My sugar free energy drink preference will probably carry over to my new career. Hopefully, so will my experience with R and Python. 
```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

##Python and R
```{r}

library(reticulate)

mo <- "Monster"
```

```{python}
mo = "Energy"
print(r.mo,mo) 
```


```{r}
cat(c(mo,py$mo))
```

There is also an example of how R and Python differ from each other when forming lists. It is interesting to contrast a simple function between the two programs because Python starts at zero, instead of one like R does. This illustrates that both are useful programming tools, but have their own little quirks. R also uses a colon for the list while Python uses range. 

##Python vs R
```{r}
twenty<- list(1:21)
twenty
```


```{python}
twenty=list(range(21))
twenty
```
