      <description>With my time at UT coming to a close, I figured I would add an appreciation post to what got me through my four years of college, Monster. Reticulate allowed me to use both R and Python to show off my favorite flavors; however, the sugar free white can is my staple. My sugar free energy drink preference will probably carry over to my new career. Hopefully, so will my experience with R and Python.</description>
